This repository contains all code to create the result files from the paper *Optimal single-Letter codes are Kelly bets*.

Some notebooks use the module RDtools.py, which can only be used with 2x2 reward and 2x2 strategy matrices. Others use RDtools2.py, which can be used for general systems, but is much more computationally expensive.

Note that the notebooks for Figures 3 and 4 use RDtools2.py and have long running times.
